Thimbl is a set of client-side tools for a distributed open source
microblogging platform. Thimbl-CLI is a set of command-line tools, and
is more modest in its ambitions than the whole of the Thimbl project.

Thimbl-CLI requires Linux/cygwin. It also includes the simplest
possible finger daemon to serve your tweets.
